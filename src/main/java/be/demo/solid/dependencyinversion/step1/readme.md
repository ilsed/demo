# Dependency Injection Principle

The **Dependency Injection (DI)** principle is about providing the dependencies that an object needs from the **outside
** rather than creating them internally.

## Example

A violation of the **Dependency Injection principle** might occur when an object creates or manages its own dependencies
within the class, rather than having them injected from the outside.
