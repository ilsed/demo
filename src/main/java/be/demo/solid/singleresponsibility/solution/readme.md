# Single Responsibility Principle

## What?

As we might expect, this principle states

* that a class should only have one responsibility.
* Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

## Benefits

* How does this principle help us to build better software? Let’s see a few of its benefits:
    * Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
    * Lower coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
    * Organization – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones.
